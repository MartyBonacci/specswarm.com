# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a promotional and educational website for SpecSwarm, a Claude Code plugin marketplace platform. The main SpecSwarm project (the plugin itself) is located at `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm`.

**Purpose**: Promote the SpecSwarm platform and educate users on how to maximize its capabilities.

**Current Status**: Repository initialized but not yet implemented. This will be a static website or web application to be determined.

## Related Projects

- **Main SpecSwarm Project**: `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm` - The actual Claude Code plugin
- **SpecSwarm Documentation**: Available at `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/README.md` and `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/docs/`

## Key Reference Materials

When working on this website, reference the following from the main SpecSwarm project:

1. **Feature Documentation**: `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/README.md` - Core features and commands
2. **Workflow Guide**: `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/docs/WORKFLOW.md` - Step-by-step user workflows
3. **Quick Reference**: `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/docs/CHEATSHEET.md` - Command cheat sheet
4. **Changelog**: `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and updates
5. **Marketplace Config**: `/home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/marketplace.json` - Plugin metadata

## Content Guidelines

When developing this website, ensure it:

1. **Promotes SpecSwarm's Core Value**: 85-90% time savings on feature development
2. **Highlights Key Features**:
   - Spec-driven development workflow
   - Autonomous orchestration capabilities
   - Quality validation and scoring
   - Tech stack enforcement
3. **Showcases Real Results**: Reference Feature 015 validation (76/76 tasks, 96.3% test pass rate)
4. **Explains Use Cases**: New features, bug fixing, refactoring, dependency upgrades
5. **Provides Getting Started Path**: Installation → initialization → first feature

## Architecture Considerations

When implementing this website:

- Consider using React Router v7 (matches SpecSwarm's recommended tech stack)
- Keep bundle sizes minimal for fast loading
- Design should be modern and developer-focused
- Include code examples and CLI command snippets
- Mobile-responsive for developers on different devices

## Content Sources

All educational content should be derived from:
- SpecSwarm README.md
- Workflow documentation
- Real-world validation results from CHANGELOG.md
- Command documentation from plugin READMEs
